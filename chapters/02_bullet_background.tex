\textbf{\large Existing BNN Approximations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item MCMC ($\sim$ Gold standard / ``Ground Truth'') (mention variants used for better scalability? SGHMC, SGLD)
    \item VI (Biased, but scales well) (mention that many variants exist?)
    \item MAP
    \item Ensemble (State-of-the-art). Mention theory on ensembles being better than the average of the members here?
    \item Last Layer Bayesian networks (simplicity, low computational effort)
\end{itemize}
Only mention dropout, Laplace (and others? which?) instead of explaining them, since we don't use them in this thesis.
