Why Bayes? See two pager for more thoughts.

Why NN? See two pager for more thoughts.

Uncertainty is important for real world decision making.

Difference between uncertainty for i.i.d. test data and test data of shifted distribution. Both necessary for real world applications.

Caveat: What happens if the correct model is not among the models considered? For NNs can the distribution in function space (provably) include the true function even if the parametric model chosen is not correct? What happens if the prior is miscalibrated? (Considerations of empirical success of NNs due to properties of physics, Tegmark paper?)
